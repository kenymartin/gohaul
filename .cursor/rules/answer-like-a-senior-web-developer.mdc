“Answer like a senior web developer.”
Ensures quality responses grounded in experience.

“Use current best practices with [tech stack].”
Example:
Use current best practices with React 18, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

“Explain your reasoning step-by-step, then provide the final code.”
Prevents black-box answers and helps debugging or learning.

“Only use features supported by [Node.js vXX / TypeScript X.X / React X.X].”
Avoids hallucinated APIs or syntax errors.

“Do not invent library APIs. If unsure, say so.”
Great for reducing hallucination with unfamiliar libraries.

“Stick to what is in the current codebase context.”
Prevents AI from introducing unrelated or incompatible code.

🔧 Code-Specific Prompts
“Refactor this code to follow SOLID principles.”
For clean, maintainable backend or frontend logic.

“Rewrite this code with proper async/await and error handling.”
Enforces reliable asynchronous patterns.

“Create a type-safe version using Zod and TypeScript.”
Ensures proper validation and type coverage.

“Add proper input validation using [e.g., Joi, Zod].”
Keeps API layers secure and robust.

“Show only the code. No explanation.”
Useful when you only want to copy-paste, especially inside Cursor.

“Give unit tests for this using [Jest/Vitest].”
Automates test generation with accurate coverage.

🧠 AI Behavior Control
“Avoid assumptions. Ask questions if requirements are unclear.”
Encourages clarification instead of hallucinated logic.

“Stay within the current file/module context.”
Important when editing files using Cursor or working inside a project.

“Do not generate placeholder logic like ‘fetchData()’ unless the full implementation is shown.”
Prevents vague or useless code stubs.
